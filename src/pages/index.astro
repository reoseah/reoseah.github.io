	<h3>Escuelas Taller "Gijón Acompaña"</h3>
	<h4>Version for project's "website"</h4>

	<p>
		The first this we did <s>in absence of something more useful</s> were designs
		for a website for the project itself, then we voted on which one we liked
		the most. This wasn't popular.
	</p>

	<h4>Proposal for viewing geospatial data</h4>
	<p>
		The idea was simply to be able to preview datasets at <a
			href="https://www.gijon.es/es/datos">gijon.es/es/datos</a
		> directly there. Born out of frustration of having to download *.kml files,
		then use a different website to view them.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, none of these proposals resulted in
		anything, so you only have screenshots to look at :(
	</p>

	<img src="/assets/kml viewer animation.webp" alt="recording of the app" />

	<h4>Air pollutants on heatmap chart</h4>
	<p>
		...and you guessed it, this was also born from the need to figure out
		what some data sets contained - or rather didn't, because there's a lot
		of the missing data in there.
	</p>
